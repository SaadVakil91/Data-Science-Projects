# Data Science Projects

## Summary:
Here you will find the list of projects that I have completed in my first three weeks of Data Science Bootcamp course. Please find below quick details of the projects:

1. **Project 1 - Visual Data Analysis:** Here I have presented an animated scatter plot of the evolution of Life Expectancy and Fertility rate from 1960 to 2015.
2. **Project 2 - Titanic Survival Rates Prediction:** Here I have trained Machine Learning models to predict survival of passengers aboard the titanic ship.
3. **Project 3 - Bike Rental Demand Prediction:** Here I have trained Machine Learning models to predict hourly demand of Bikes in Washington DC.
4. **Project 4 - Artist Prediction from Song Lyrics:** Here I have trained Machine Learning models to predict artist from a given line of song

## Technologies Used:
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7.3

## Folder Structure:
Each project folder has three subfolders:
* **code:** This contains the code for each of the projects
* **data:** This contains the source data used to do the analysis on the projects
* **plots:** This contains any output plots that is linked to the projects

*Note: I will keep updating the readme as I complete more projects.*
