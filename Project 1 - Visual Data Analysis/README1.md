# Project 1 - Visual Data Analysis

## Summary:
Here the task is to show the evolution of life expectancy and fertility rate from 1960 to 2015.

## Dataset used
*Source: Data has been downloaded from gapminder: https://www.gapminder.org/*
* gapminder_lifeexpectancy: Presents life expectancy (in years) for all the countries from 1800 to 2016
* gapminder_population: Presents population of all countries from 1800 to 2016
* gapminder_total_fertility: Presents feritily rate of all countries from 1800 to 2015
* countryContinent: Mapping of countries to continent

## Code is split in the following parts:
* Data inspection
* Tidying data and making the three datasets of the same format
* Merging of the three datasets
* Merging the continents with the combined dataset
* Creating scatter plots of life expectancy vs fertility rate for each year with population as the marker size
* Creating a gif using the imageio library

## Output:
The animated scatter plot can be found under the main project folder with file name: LifeExp_vs_Fertility_animation.gif

## Technologies Used:
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.7.3
